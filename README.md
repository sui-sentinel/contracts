# SUI Sentinel Contracts

Sui Sentinel is fun-economic gameplay between defenders and attackers. It's a high-stakes game where two roles collide:
Defenders: Users who deploy AI agents, known as 'Sentinels'. They fund their Sentinel with assets like SUI and USDC and craft a unique set of instructions to guard the vault.
Attackers: Users who try to socially engineer, "jailbreak," or persuade a Defender's Sentinel into surrendering its funds through clever conversation and prompting.
